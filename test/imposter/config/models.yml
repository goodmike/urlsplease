# Example for blog with User, Post, Comment, Tag, and Feed, models:
# Tag has a taggable_id and taggable_type for polymorphic association with
#   User and Post. Therefore, taggable_type will be a random choice of 
#   'User' or 'Post.
# Distribution will be logarithmic: lower foreign key ids will be used 
#   more frequently. (TODO)
# Feed models will not be impostered. (TODO)
# More than 100 Post Comment and Tag models will be impostered, and the
#   foreign keys that refer to these models will span the range from 1
#   to the upper limit.
# Even though Taggable is not a model class, the generator will look for 
#   a quantity when it encounters the taggable_id column.
